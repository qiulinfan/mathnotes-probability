1. Suppose that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable $F: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is strictly increasing and continuous. Let $U$ be a random variable with the uniform distribution on $(0,1)$ and define
$$
X:=F^{-1}(U) .
$$
Show that $X$ has CDF equal to $F$.
This exercise shows us how to construct a random variable with given distribution, assuming that we have a uniform random variable.
\begin{proof}

2. A gas station fills its tank completely once a week. 
Let the weekly sales volume (in thousands of liters) be a random variable with density
$$
f(x)= \begin{cases}a(1-x)^4, & x \in(0,1), \\ 0, & \text { otherwise } .\end{cases}
$$
Find the constant $a$. What should be the tank capacity 
so that the probability of running out of fuel during a given week is $1 / 100$ ?
\begin{solution}

3. Let the random variable $X$ have density
$$
f_X(x)= \begin{cases}\frac{1}{2 x^2}, & |x| \geq 1, \\ 0, & |x|<1 .\end{cases}
$$
Find the probability density function of $Y:=X^2$ and 
compute the probability $\mathbb{P}(2 Y+3 \leq 10)$.
\begin{solution}


\end{solution}



4. Let the random variable $X$ have density $f$, 
which is symmetric about $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$, 
that is, $f(\mu+x)= f(\mu-x)$, for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. 
Show that $\mathbb{P}(X \leq \mu)=\mathbb{P}(X \geq \mu)$. 
If in addition $\mathbb{E}|X|<\infty$, show that $\mathbb{E}(X)=\mu$.
 Can you use this observation if $X \sim N(0,1)$ ?
\begin{proof}

5. An airline has observed that $5 \%$ of ticket holders do not show up for their flight. Today's flight has an airplane with 200 seats, and the airline has sold 203 tickets.
What is the probability that the airline will not be able to accommodate a ticketed passenger? Assume that, for each passenger $i$, 
the event $A_i$ that passenger $i$ shows up is independent of all others,
for $1 \leq i \leq 203$.
\begin{solution}


\end{solution}




6. Consider a sequence of tosses of a fair die. We continue tossing until both outcomes 3 and 4 have appeared at least once. For example, 
one possible sequence of results is
$$
5,1,1,4,6,5,4,2,6,3,
$$
and we then stop. Let $X$ be the number of tosses required (in this example, $X=10$ ).
What is the expected value of the random variable $X$ ?
